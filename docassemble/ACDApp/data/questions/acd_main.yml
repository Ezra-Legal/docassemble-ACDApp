question: Advance Care Directive Form
subquestion: |
  This app will guide you through completing an Advanced Care 
  Directive form which you can then print out and sign.

  **An Advance Care Directive is a legal form that allows people over the age of 18 years to:**

  * write down your wishes, preferences and instructions for future health care, end of
  life, living arrangements and personal matters and/or
  * appoint one or more Substitute Decision-Makers to make these decisions on your
  behalf when you are unable to do so yourself.

  **Your Advance Care Directive Form must be printed, signed and witnessed**

  Your witness also has obligations which must be completed when the form is signed.
  For more information, please see the SA Health [Advance Care Directive website](https://advancecaredirectives.sa.gov.au/information-for-you/information-for-you)
