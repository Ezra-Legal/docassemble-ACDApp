question: When EPA Becomes effective
subquestion: |
  You decide when your EPA becomes effective.

  If you choose 'Upon Execution', your EPA becomes effective
  as soon as all the parties sign it.  From that point 
  onwards, your donee(s) and any alternates can exercise
  your power of attorney

  If you choose 'Upon Incapacity', your EPA becomes
  effective if you lose the capacity to make decisions 
  on your own. Until you lose capacity your donee(s) and
  any alternates cannot exercise your power of attorney

  I would like my Power of Attorney to become effective:

  ANY SUBSEQUENT LEGAL INCAPACITY AND I AUTHORISE MY
