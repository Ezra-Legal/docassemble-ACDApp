question: Enduring Power of Attorney
subquestion: |
  This app will guide you through preparing an Enduring Power of Attorney which 
  you can then print and sign.

  An Enduring Power of Attorney (or 'EPA') is a legal document
  that gives a person or people you nominate the power to make financial decisions
  on your behalf when you become incapacitated.

  **Note**: An EPA is for financial matters. For health-related 
  decisions you should complete an [Advance Care Directive](https://docassemble.achelp.net/interview?i=docassemble.ACDApp%3Adata%2Fquestions%2Facd_main.yml#page1)
  
  This app guides you through preparing an simple EPA that:

  1. delegates authority to one or  more 'donees' (ie: people you appoint)
  1. delegates authority to one or more 'alternate donees' (who become donees 
  in case your donees become incpacitated)

  If you prefer an EPA tailored to your needs then please
  [contact us](https://ezralegal.com.au/contact-us)

  **Disclaimer**

  This app and the documents it produces
  is not a substitute for legal advice.
    If you would like help completing your
